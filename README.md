# GeoSecureEncrypt - Location-Based AES Encryption Tool

A cybersecurity prototype demonstrating geo-location based encryption using AES-GCM with SHA-256 key derivation.

## ðŸŽ¯ Purpose
Educational demonstration for college cybersecurity project showing how location-based encryption can be implemented using industry-standard cryptographic algorithms.

``bash
python3 -m venv geo_encrypt_env
source geo_encrypt_env/bin/activate  # On Windows: geo_encrypt_env\Scripts\activate
```

### 2. Install dependencies
```bash
pip install pycryptodome
# or
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
